# Client (Vite React)

This folder contains the frontend built with Vite + React.

Quick start:

1. cd client
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 and the app should connect to the backend at http://localhost:4000

Notes:
- Tailwind is included via CDN in `index.html` for quick styling during development.
- If you want production Tailwind builds, add PostCSS/Tailwind config and import the generated CSS in `src/index.css`.
